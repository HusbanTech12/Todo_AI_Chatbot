- User Story 2: Conversation state persistence across sessions
- User Story 3: Secure access to personal data (highest priority)
- User Story 4: AI-driven actions through MCP tools
- Error handling and resilience features
- Logging and observability
- Cross-cutting concerns and polish

## Implementation Strategy
- MVP approach focusing on core functionality first
- Incremental delivery with each user story building on previous
- Parallel execution opportunities identified for faster development
- Dependency tracking for proper sequencing

## Outcome
Complete task breakdown ready for implementation with all constitutional requirements verified and all necessary components accounted for.

## Evaluation
All tasks properly formatted with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities clearly identified.
